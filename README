# Uses guest names and email to randomize gift-giving. Similar to a Secret Santa event. 
# Currently only tested in using entry method 2 (entering each guest and email manually on-site rather than with a text file).
# Based on secret santa program by Monique Chen https://github.com/itsliterallymonique
# SMTP allowances and permissions have changed as 2FA and other security measures have changed, therefore I edited the code and my own domain SMTP to create a scenario where this code works. 
# Likely, entering your own email and password will result in errors without self-hosting.
# Errors are present in lines 155 and 156, but script still functions. See Issues tab for explanation.
